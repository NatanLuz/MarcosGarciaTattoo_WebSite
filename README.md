#### Before this project, Marcos Garcia lacked a professional digital presence to showcase his work. His portfolio was limited to social media, which:

‚Ä¢ Made it harder to stand out in a competitive industry

‚Ä¢ Limited control over how his art was presented

‚Ä¢ Created barriers for potential clients to book directly

##### SOLUTION DELIVERED

The website provided:

‚Ä¢ A dedicated, professional space for his tattoo portfolio
‚Ä¢ Clear navigation and filtering of styles (Black & Grey/Realism, Color, Letters)
‚Ä¢ Direct and simplified booking/contact options (WhatsApp, Instagram, Email)
‚Ä¢ A consistent visual identity aligned with his personal brand
‚Ä¢ Classic tattoo typography that enhances brand authenticity

#### Client Feedback & Results

‚Ä¢ Marcos was very satisfied with the outcome, highlighting that the site elevated his professional image.

‚Ä¢ He now has a centralized hub to share with clients, instead of relying only on social media.

‚Ä¢ The new platform has improved client trust, visibility, and lead generation, supporting business growth.

‚Ä¢ The addition of the Letters portfolio section and enhanced typography further strengthened his brand identity.
